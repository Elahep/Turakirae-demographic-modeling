# Testing phylogeographic models for the recolonization of *D. antarctica* at Turakirae

Here we used the R package DelimitR (Smith & Carstens, 2019) to choose the most likely recolonization scenario for the "uplift" lineages of *D. antarctica* in the Turakirae region.

Different recolonization models were defined based on empirically-derived regional population structure. Accordingly, we defined 4-population models incorporating the Wellington, Western Turakirae, Eastern Turakirae, and Southern Wairarapa lineages.
