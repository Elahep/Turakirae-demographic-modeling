# Testing phylogeographic models for the recolonization of D. antarctica at Turakirae

Here we used the R package DelimitR (Smith & Carstens, 2019) to choose the most likely recolonization scenario for the "uplift" lineages of D. antarctica in the Turakirae region.
Different recolonization models were defined based on empirically-derived regional population structure.
